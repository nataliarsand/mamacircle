      <p>
        If you're a new mama feeling overwhelmed, emotional, or simply in need of a kind word — this space is for you.  
        You are not alone. This circle exists to remind you that support is real and close, even when it doesn’t feel that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might come across someone who says:<br/>
        <em>“I’m part of #mamacircle — you can always reach out to me.”</em><br/>
        And they’ll mean it.

      <h2>The Mama Circle Manifesto</h2>

      <div class="poetic">
        <p>
          When you're tired — we offer understanding.<br/>
          When you're overwhelmed — we offer calm.<br/>
          When you're unsure — we offer stories.<br/>
          When you're lonely — we offer connection.<br/>
          When you're lost — we offer each other.<br/>
          And if we’re nearby — we’ll bring tea, hold your baby, clean your kitchen, or simply give you a hug.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>We are mamas supporting mamas. These are the values we carry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Connection <strong>over</strong> isolation</li>
        <li>Listening <strong>over</strong> advising</li>
        <li>Presence <strong>over</strong> perfection</li>
        <li>Compassion <strong>over</strong> comparison</li>
        <li>Community <strong>over</strong> competition</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">This is the spirit of Mama Circle — not about being perfect, but being present.</p>
