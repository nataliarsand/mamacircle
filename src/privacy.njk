  <h2>What is Mama Circle?</h2>
  <p>
    Mama Circle is a grassroots, community-led initiative. It exists to gently connect mothers who wish to support each other with honesty, softness, and care.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not a company, coaching service, or moderated platform. You are witnessing, or joining, a self-organized collective of mamas supporting mamas through the quiet signal of <span class="hashtag">#mamacircle 💞</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>What personal data do we collect?</h2>
