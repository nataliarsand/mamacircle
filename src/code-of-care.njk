    Mama Circle is a self-organized, trust-based signal of care. To keep this space soft, supportive, and safe, we invite anyone using the
    <span class="hashtag">#mamacircle 💞</span> tag to honor the following:
  </p>


  <h2>Show up with care</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Respond gently.</strong> New mothers may be feeling tender, overwhelmed, or unsure.</li>
    <li><strong>Hold space.</strong> Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is simply witness.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect silence.</strong> Nobody owes a response, your presence alone may be enough.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Honor boundaries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Only offer connection</strong> where it feels welcome and mutual.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't pressure others</strong> to reply, meet, or share more than they wish.</li>
    <li><strong>Never use the hashtag</strong> for self-promotion, selling, or business purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Protect each other</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Report misuse.</strong> If you see the hashtag being used in harmful ways, let us know by sending an email to <code>hello@mamacircle.me</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> It's okay to ignore or block anyone who feels unsafe to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Prioritize emotional safety</strong>, yours and theirs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Be inclusive</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Everyone deserves kindness</strong>, no matter their background, parenting style, or identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Use affirming language.</strong> Avoid assumptions about someone's journey or story.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Remember: you're human too</h2>
  <p>You don't have to be perfect to offer care. You just need to be present.</p>

  <p>
    The Circle lives in the quiet care we show one another, in the small moments of connection.
    <strong>Thank you for being part of this. 💞</strong>
