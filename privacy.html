      <h2>What is Mama Circle?</h2>
      <p>
        Mama Circle is a grassroots, community-led initiative. We exist to connect mothers who wish to support each other with honesty, softness, and care. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a company, coaching service, or moderated forum. You are joining a self-organized collective of mamas supporting mamas.
