        The Mama Circle is a self-organized, trust-based network. To keep this space soft, supportive, and safe, we ask all who use the <code>#mamacircle ðŸ’ž</code> signal or appear on this site to honor the following:
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Show up with care</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Respond gently. New mothers may be feeling vulnerable or overwhelmed.</li>
        <li>Hold space. Sometimes just listening is the most powerful thing you can do.</li>
        <li>Respect silence. Nobody owes a response â€” presence is enough.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Honor boundaries</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only reach out to someone who has made themselves publicly available.</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t pressure others to respond, meet, or share more than they want to.</li>
        <li>Never use this space for self-promotion, business, or selling services.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Protect each other</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you see the hashtag being used in a way that feels harmful, <a href="mailto:hello@mamacircle.me">report it</a>.</li>
        <li>If someone reaches out in a way that feels unsafe, itâ€™s okay to block and ignore â€” and let us know.</li>
        <li>Trust your instincts. If something feels off, take a step back.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Be inclusive</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Everyone deserves kindness â€” regardless of background, parenting style, or life choices.</li>
        <li>Use language that includes and affirms. Avoid assumptions about someoneâ€™s journey or identity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Remember: youâ€™re human too</h2>
      <p>
        You donâ€™t need to be perfect to support someone. You just need to be present.
      </p>
